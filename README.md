## Description

The purpose of this project was to create an application/coding game that prepares users for a job interview. The user battles TAs and eventually gets to the "Boss" Instructor. To progress through the game the user is asked a series of coding questions which if they answer wrong will remove 50 hit points from their overall health. If the user answers the question correctly they will hit the TA/Boss for 50 hit points. Once either the user or TA/Boss' health equals 0 then the game is over. From an administrative perspective, the admin is able to create, read, update and delete questions & answers from the associated database. Additional technologies that have been used are the Animate.css library and the incorporation of audio into the game. The ultimate desire for this application is to provide a fun and interesting way to learn more about full stack technologies while preparing for job interviews.
